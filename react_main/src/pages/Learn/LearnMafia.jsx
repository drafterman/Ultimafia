            Mafia is a game of social deception where an informed minority (the
            Mafia) compete against the uniformed majority (the Village). The
            Mafia choose one player to kill each night, and they win the game if
            they successfully outnumber the non-mafia players at any point.
            Everyone votes to execute one person during the day, with the
            Village aiming to eliminate all mafia members.
          </div>
          <div className="paragraph">
            In addition to the Village and the Mafia, there are two other
            alignments: Independent and Cult. Independents are not aligned with
            a side and usually have their own unique win condition. The Cult
            meets together and win if they reach the majority just like the
            Mafia, but they do not vote to kill someone each night.

          <div className="paragraph">
            At the beginning of a game, each player is given a role. This role
            may grant the player special abilities, usually in the form of
            actions they can take to aid their side. A list of all roles and
            their abilities can be found below.
